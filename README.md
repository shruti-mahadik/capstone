# CAPSTONE PROJECT

# Point of Use Temperature and Humidity Monitoring system
A prototype which is independently  powered  and  monitored  real-time  variations  in temperature  and  humidity. These real-time levels of temperature and humidity  wirelessly  send to the end-user and calibrated and presented in graphical format to ensure suitable data provision over the platform and in suitable intervals. 

# Introduction
The  designed prototype is simple  and  feasible.  The significance of the prototype is to monitors  real-time  variations  in  humidity  and  temperature. The DHT22  temperature and humidity sensor is interfaced with PIC18F45K22 microcontroller to initiate data transmission from the sensor. These live readings are sent wirelessly to the user using  Wi-Fi-module  (ESP8266).  This  data  is  transmitted  on  the  user’s  terminal  using  a designated server and display variations in readable graphical format. 


# Purpose
The proposed product called “The Point of Use Temperature and Humidity Monitoring” is a new product  in the  industry  that  tracks the  heat  and  humidity transfer  of  the  wall  being measured. This is an independently powered setup where sensors would calculate live data and processed data is sent to the mobile app via Wi-Fi module. Also, this data is sent to the website to get graphical data. The HMI component in this product is important for leman to understand the change in the data, this specification is not present in the existed products and designs.


# Scope of Deliverables
  Sensors used in the design are independently powered using AC power adapter of design decisions. Sensors are positioned across the wall to get required readings in the given requirements. Sensors can process the collected data using microcontroller procedures and wirelessly sending to the mobile app. 
  Sensors can produce and record temperature range from-50◦C - 80◦C and a relative humidity  range  from  30-100%.  Sensors  can operate  and  read  data  during  varied weather conditions and are also able to report data on a user specified interval. 
  The collected data is exported in a suitable graphical format for user interface. HMI component is added for user end along with mentioned specifications to meet all customer requirements. This was all validated through test reports and documentation.
